# Winter 2020 Shopify Internship iOS Code Challenge 

 My version of the matching card game lets the user customize the grid size by given the option of selecting a difficulty from Easy to Hard
Users can customize they player' name. The Number of matching card to win the game is from 10 (minimum) to 15 (maximum).
I tested the UI mainly on IphoneX and later versions. 

 I implemented the shuffle button to shuffle the cards of the grid during the game. There's a turn indictor as well as score board 
to keep track of each player's score. The cards are always randomly place on the board. 

 If you want to challenge yourself, the Hard mode has some card that have between 3 to 4 card match.

 Hope you Enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it! üòÅ
